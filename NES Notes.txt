How to Edit Dungeons:

use dungeonmaster program. This allows you to change all aspects of
a dungeon. You can add enemies, items, people, whatever.

How to edit text:

use the FCEUX emulator's hex editor. You can load TBL files
(which I made) to change the hex into ascii. Then find the text you need
and change it.

how to edit overworld: 
use zeldaTech to edit overworld. You can change the overworld, but you can't
add custom textures. You can, I believe, modify in game textures so I can do that.
You must run zeldaTech as administrator.
